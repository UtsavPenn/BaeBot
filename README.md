# BaeBot
A multi purpose Telegram Bot using serverless.com

### Deploying
```serverless deploy -v```

### Testing

Run your tests by:

```python -m pytest tests/``` (just running pytest won't work as PYTHONPATH is not set)

If you are using Pycharm (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download), then the PYTHONPATH is automatically set.
